                            <p>
                                Ester Raizy's diverse background in healthcare started with
                                practicing pediatrics and dermatology before immersing herself
                                into the world of plastic surgery. She honed her craft under
                                the mentorship of renowned plastic surgeon Ari Fleisher (of
                                blessed memory) in Brooklyn. She now collaborates with Dr.
                                Green, a pillar of excellence in the plastic surgery community
                                with over 35 years of distinguished experience in Cleveland.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Having a naturally creative spirit and an adeptness with her
                                hands, Ester was inspired to venture into plastic surgery
                                during her surgery and ER rotations in PA school. Observers
                                would often commend her stitching skills, suggesting she
                                explore the field of plastics — and that's precisely what she
                                did.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For Ester, patient care is paramount. She places a strong
                                emphasis on ensuring both the patient and their guardians are
                                well-informed, comfortable, and, above all, cared for.
                                Integrity is the bedrock of her practice; she believes in
                                always being truthful to her patients, valuing their trust
                                above all.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Professionally, Ester finds immense satisfaction in her work,
                                particularly in the happiness of her patients. She counts
                                every satisfied patient as a major accomplishment, taking
                                pride in having saved countless fingers throughout her career.
                                Patient feedback and commendations from her peers keep her
                                motivated. The fact that patients travel specifically to Ester
                                Raizy for treatment is a testament to her reputation in the
                                medical community.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Ester remains at the forefront of her field through continuous
                                learning. She holds an NCCPA certification and frequently
                                collaborates, observes, and learns from fellow surgeons to
                                keep herself updated with the latest techniques and
                                innovations.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Away from the office, Ester channels her dexterity into her
                                hobbies. She is passionate about activities involving her
                                hands, such as cooking, baking, and painting. Additionally,
                                she enjoys the great outdoors, often finding herself on hiking
                                trails to rejuvenate and relax.
